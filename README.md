# pandoc-ci

Intended for CI use only. Makes changes to source files!

Here is a modified version of the `pandoc container` used to generate company documents. These images contain pandoc⁠, the universal document converter, and a basic LaTeX⁠ installation for conversions to PDF.

Using pandoc together with LaTeX⁠ is a popular option to create PDF files from other formats. This image provides a TeX Live⁠ installation and contains all packages required to produce a PDF with pandoc’s default options.

## Changelog:
